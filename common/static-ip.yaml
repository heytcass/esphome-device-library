# Optional Static IP Configuration Package
#
# Include this package if you need to assign static IP addresses to your devices.
# This is useful when:
# - mDNS (.local) resolution doesn't work reliably on your network
# - You need consistent IP addresses for firewall rules or port forwarding
# - OTA updates fail with "Error resolving IP address" errors
#
# Usage:
# 1. Add network-wide secrets to your secrets.yaml file (gateway, subnet)
# 2. Define device-specific IP in your device config substitutions:
#
#    substitutions:
#      wifi_static_ip: "192.168.1.100"
#
# 3. Include this package in your device configuration:
#
#    packages:
#      static_ip: github://heytcass/esphome-device-library/common/static-ip.yaml@main
#
# Note: DNS servers are not configured here - the device will use default DNS resolution.
# If you need custom DNS servers, add dns1/dns2 fields to your device config.
#
# Make sure to also reserve this IP in your router's DHCP settings to avoid conflicts.
