## 🚀 Quick Start

### Method 1: ESPHome Dashboard (Easiest)

For dashboard-compatible devices (Athom, AirGradient), use the one-click install:

1. Open ESPHome Dashboard
2. Click "New Device" → "Continue" → "Skip"
3. Click "Edit" and paste the dashboard import URL from the [device page](docs/DEVICES.md)
4. Click "Install"

### Method 2: External Package Import (Recommended)

Use these device configurations directly in your ESPHome setup:

```yaml
substitutions:
  device_name: my-air-monitor
  friendly_name: "Office Air Quality"
  # Device-specific customizations (optional)
  led_strip_brightness: "20%"  # For AirGradient

esphome:
  name: ${device_name}
  friendly_name: ${friendly_name}

packages:
  base:
    url: https://github.com/heytcass/esphome-device-library
    ref: main  # or v1.0.0 for pinned version
    files:
      - common/base.yaml           # Core ESPHome services
      - common/esp32-platform.yaml # Platform config (ESP32/ESP8266/ESP32-C3)
      - common/diagnostics.yaml    # Sensors, switches, updates
      - common/web-server.yaml     # Optional: Web interface
      - devices/airgradient/one-v9.yaml  # Device hardware
    refresh: 1d

wifi:
  ap:
    ssid: "${friendly_name} Fallback"
```

**Available common packages:**

## 🎨 Design Principles

This library follows **strict engineering principles**:

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Common components extracted to `common/` directory
- Zero duplicate restart/safe_mode switches across devices
- Modular web server configuration
- Shared diagnostic sensors

### Modularity
- Mix and match components (base + platform + device + optional packages)
- Optional features (web server, BLE) via separate includes
- Device-specific hardware isolated from common services

### Modern Best Practices (Oct 2025)
- Latest ESPHome component patterns
- Dual WiFi provisioning (USB + BLE)
- Debug monitoring built-in
- Firmware update notifications
- Entity categories for proper HA organization

### Production Quality
- CI validation on every commit
- Tested configurations
- Comprehensive documentation
- GPIO pinout tables
- Calibration instructions

## 📖 Development Environment

This repository includes a fully reproducible development environment using Nix flakes:

- **ESPHome** - Validation and compilation
- **Git** - Version control
- **Python** - Scripting support
- **yamllint** - YAML validation

NixOS users get automatic environment setup via `flake.nix` and `.envrc`. Non-NixOS users can use the repository normally with pip-installed ESPHome.

## 💡 Usage Tips

### Customize Entity Names
Use substitutions to customize sensor names per device:

```yaml
substitutions:
  device_name: bedroom-plug
  friendly_name: "Bedroom"
```

All sensors will be prefixed with your friendly name in Home Assistant.

### Mix and Match Packages
Don't need the web server? Just exclude it:

```yaml
packages:
  base: !include ../../common/base.yaml
  diagnostics: !include ../../common/diagnostics.yaml
  # web_server: !include ../../common/web-server.yaml  # Commented out
  hardware: !include ../../devices/sonoff/s31.yaml
```

### Pin to Specific Versions
For production use, pin to tagged releases:

```yaml
packages:
  base:
    url: https://github.com/heytcass/esphome-device-library
    ref: v1.0.0  # Pin to specific version
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### OTA Update Fails with "Error resolving IP address"

If you see errors like:
```
ERROR Error resolving IP address of ['device-name.local']. Is it connected to WiFi?
ERROR Timeout resolving IP address: Timeout while resolving IP address
```

This happens when mDNS (`.local` hostname resolution) doesn't work reliably on your network. The solution is to use static IP addresses:

**Step 1:** Include the static IP package in your device configuration:
```yaml
packages:
  base: github://heytcass/esphome-device-library/common/base.yaml@main
  static_ip: github://heytcass/esphome-device-library/common/static-ip.yaml@main  # Add this line
  platform: github://heytcass/esphome-device-library/common/esp32-platform.yaml@main
  hardware: github://heytcass/esphome-device-library/devices/sonoff/s31.yaml@main
```

**Step 2:** Add static IP configuration to your `secrets.yaml`:
```yaml
# Static IP Configuration (one set per device)
wifi_static_ip: "192.168.1.100"  # Choose an unused IP on your network
wifi_gateway: "192.168.1.1"       # Your router's IP
wifi_subnet: "255.255.255.0"      # Usually this
wifi_dns1: "1.1.1.1"              # Cloudflare DNS
wifi_dns2: "8.8.8.8"              # Google DNS
```

**Step 3:** Reserve the IP in your router's DHCP settings to prevent conflicts.

**Note:** If you have multiple devices, you can create device-specific secret files or use per-device substitutions. See the [secrets documentation](https://esphome.io/guides/faq.html#tips-for-using-esphome) for advanced patterns.
