# Optional Static IP Configuration Package
#
# Include this package if you need to assign static IP addresses to your devices.
# This is useful when:
# - mDNS (.local) resolution doesn't work reliably on your network
# - You need consistent IP addresses for firewall rules or port forwarding
# - OTA updates fail with "Error resolving IP address" errors
#
# Usage:
# 1. Add the required secrets to your secrets.yaml file (see secrets.yaml.example)
# 2. Include this package in your device configuration:
#
#    packages:
#      static_ip: github://heytcass/esphome-device-library/common/static-ip.yaml@main
#
# Note: This configures the device to request a specific IP from your router.
# Make sure to also reserve this IP in your router's DHCP settings to avoid conflicts.
